1) We can use the "with" binding to set the context of the current object.

2) After defining the "Object" using the "with" binding, we can now directly
call the properties and function of that particular object.

ex:
<div id="cat-count-container" class="col-sm-12" data-bind="with: currentCat">
    <h2 class="cat-name text-center" data-bind="text: name"></h2>
</div>

Here 'currentCat' is the object and the 'name' is the property of the currentCat. We also don't need to use the object as the observable i.e.
'currentCat()' and the observable property of the object as the observable i.e. 'name()'.

3) To grab the ViewModel object, we can use $root property to access all its
properties and functions.
